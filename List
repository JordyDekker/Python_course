Make a list `list1` with `10` integer elements.
- Print the 5th element from the list.
- Make a list `list2` from list1 that does not include the 0th, 4th, and 5th elements.
- What is the sum of all the items in the `list1` list (use the `sum()` builtin function).
- Sum only the elements from `list1` which are between the 2nd and the 6th elements.

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , 7, 8, 9, 10]
list1[5]
list2 = list1[1:4] + list1[5:10]
print[list2]
